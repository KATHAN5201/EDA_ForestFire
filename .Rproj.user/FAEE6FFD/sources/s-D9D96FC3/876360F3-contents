## Introduction

* Forest fires can create ecological problems and endanger human lives and property. Understanding when they occur and what causes them is important for managing them.

**Visualization** is one of the most important skills that every Data Analyst should possess. In this project, I perform the most simple form of **Exploratory data analyses** of [Forest Fire data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/).

This data-set about forest fires occurring in Portugal and based on this [scientific research paper](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/fires.pdf).

**Main Goal**:To find our patterns in occurrence of forest fire  

## Initial Setup
```{r Setup, message=FALSE}
#importing data
library(tidyverse)
forest_fire = read_csv("forestfires.csv")
```

## Getting premliminary isights

```{r}
glimpse(forest_fire)
```

So there are `r nrow(forest_fire)` and `r ncol(forest_fire)` in our data set.Let's  see some of the rows.

```{r}
head(forest_fire, n=11)
```

### Description of Various Columns
Here are descriptions of the variables in the data set and the range of values for each taken from the paper:

* X: X-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
* Y: Y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
* month: Month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'
* day: Day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'
* FFMC: Fine Fuel Moisture Code index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
* DMC: Duff Moisture Code index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
* DC: Drought Code index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
* ISI: Initial Spread Index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
* temp: Temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
* RH: Relative humidity in percentage: 15.0 to 100
* wind: Wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
rain: Outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
* area: The burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84


> The X and Y variables are coordinates of fire locations.
>
> The acronym FWI stands for "fire weather index", a method 
used by scientists to quantify risk factors for forest fires.

## Visualizing relation b/w forest fire and Weekdays & Months

```{r}
#generic function to create bar graphs
create_bar <- function(dframe,x, y){
  ggplot(data = dframe,
         aes_string(x, y)
  )+
    geom_bar(stat="identity")+
    labs(y="Total Forest Fires")+
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"))
}
```


```{r}
forest_fire_by_month <- forest_fire %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    .groups="drop"
  )%>%
  mutate(
    month = factor(month,
                   levels=c("jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may",
                            "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct",
                            "nov", "dec")
                   )
  )
```
```{r}
forest_fire_by_day <- forest_fire %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    .groups="drop"
  )%>%
  mutate(
    day = factor(day, 
                 levels=c("sun", "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu",
                          "fri", "sat")
    )
  )
```

```{r}
#plotting the bar graphs
create_bar(forest_fire_by_day,"day", "count")
create_bar(forest_fire_by_month, "month", "count")
```

### Examining spread of various factors using Box plots

```{r}
create_box <- function( x, y){
  ggplot(data=forest_fire,
         aes_string(x=x,
                    y=y
                    )
         )+
    geom_boxplot()+
    theme(panel.background = element_rect("white"))
}
```

```{r}
#Creating various box plots by vectorization

x_var_month <- names(forest_fire)[3] ## month
x_var_day <- names(forest_fire)[4] ## day
y_var <- names(forest_fire)[5:12]

month_box <- map2(x_var_month, y_var, create_box)
day_box <- map2(x_var_day, y_var, create_box)

```
```{r month box}
month_box
day_box
```

### Examining the relation b/w Area and various factors
```{r}
#generic function to create scatter
create_scatter <- function(x, y){
  ggplot(data=forest_fire,
         aes_string(
           x=x,
           y=y 
         ))+
    geom_point()+
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"))
}
```
```{r}
x_var_scatter = names(forest_fire)[5:12]
y_var_scatter = names(forest_fire)[13] ##area

scatters <- map2(x_var_scatter, y_var_scatter, create_scatter)
scatters
```

We can notice that the scatter plot is clustered in bottom because there are very few high values of `area` and more values are spread in lower range.

- Let's try to see the range of `area` column
```{r}
summary(forest_fire$area)
```
Looking at the 3rd quartile we can conclude that more than 75%
of the values of `area` are less than `6.57`. 

For more clarity let's plot a histogram of `area` column

```{r area column, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(forest_fire,
       aes(
         x=area
       ))+
  geom_histogram()
```
And Indeed, it is the case.

## Conclusion

We conclude that how important it is to visualize data.It will
help us in making various statistical models for performing predictions.
