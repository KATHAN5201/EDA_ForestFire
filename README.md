# Exploratory Data Analyses on Forest Fire Data
* Forest fires can create ecological problems and endanger human lives and property. Understanding when they occur and what causes them is important for managing them.

**Visualization** is one of the most important skills that every Data Analyst should possess. In this project, I perform the most simple form of **Exploratory data analyses** of [Forest Fire data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/).

This data-set about forest fires occurring in Portugal and based on this [scientific research paper](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/fires.pdf).

**Main Goal**:To find our patterns in occurrence of forest fire
